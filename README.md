This system consists of two phases; the detection phase
which is used to detect car accident in low and high speeds. The
notification phase, and immediately after an accident is indicated, is used
to send detailed information such as images, video, accident location, etc.
to the emergency responder for fast recovery. The system was practically
tested in real simulated environment and achieved quite very good
performance results.
